# hello-world
This is my first repository
I love reading classical novels, I like some authors like Proust because it makes me feel that I have feelings in common and well, I want to learn data science and machine learning, I hope to use those skills and combine with my carreer, physics. 
Also I have a cat and I love it so much, its name is Pimpis. 
Oh, I have forgotten my dog, haha, its name is Kayser.
